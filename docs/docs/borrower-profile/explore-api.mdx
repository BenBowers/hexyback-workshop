# Explore Borrower API

1. In your browser, navigate to the `Create a Borrower` API documentation:

    ```text
    http://localhost:3000/hexyback-workshop/docs/hexy/create-a-borrower
    ```

2. Modify the sample request body:

  ```json
  { 
    "name": "ben",
    "email": "ben.bowers@journeyone.com",
    "dob": "1999-01-01",
    "creditScore": 500
  }
  ```
3. Copy the `curl` request, replacing `http://localhost:3000` with the URL of your deployed API endpoint - `apiEndpoint`:

  ```shell
  âœ”  Deployed:
   ConfigStack
   # Use the URL shown below
   apiEndpoint: https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod/ 
  ```

4. Paste the `curl` request into your terminal and hit `Enter`:

  ```shell
  curl -L -X POST 'https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod/borrower' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "name": "ben",
    "email": "ben.bowers@journeyone.com",
    "dob": "1999-01-01",
    "creditScore": 500
  }'
  ```

5. Navigate to the AWS Lambda console and select the `CreateBorrowerProfile` lambda

6. Navigate to the `Monitor` tab:

7. Click on the first entry in the `Traces` tab:

  ![Navigate to the `Traces` tab for the `CreateBorrowerProfile` lambda](/img/borrower/navigate-to-traces-tab-for-create-borrower-profile-lambda.png)

  Observe the traces shown. You'll notice two calls:
    - A call to (attempt) to get the borrower profile
    - A call to put the borrower profile 

## Exercise:

1. Attempt to create the same borrower. What happens? Observe the traces to confirm your assumptions.
