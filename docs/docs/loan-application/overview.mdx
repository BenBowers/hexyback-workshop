  Create Borrower Profile: Borrower Profile Persisted
```

## Apply for a loan

```mermaid
timeline
    Get Borrower Profile : Look up Borrower Profile w/ Email Address
    Collect Additional Information: Employment Status, Gross Annual Income, Monthly Expenses

    Create Loan Application: Loan Application Persisted
```

1. User initiates a request to apply for a loan through a client application.
2. The request is received by the primary adaptor: `api-gw-apply-for-loan`.
3. The primary adaptor validates the request and forwards it to the `process-loan-application` use case in the domain layer.
4. The `process-loan-application` use case interacts with the `ddb-get-borrower-profile` secondary adapter to retrieve borrower details from DynamoDB.
5. The `process-loan-application` use case processes the application and uses a secondary adaptor `ddb-put-loan-application` to persist the loan application to DynamoDB.
6. The loan application application status is returned to the user through the primary adaptor.

## `process-loan-application` Use Case

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start: Process Loan Application] --> B{Retrieve Borrower Profile}
    B -- Profile Exists --> C[Assess Loan Application]
    B -- Profile Does Not Exist --> D[Throw BorrowerProfileDoesNotExistError]
    C --> E[Record Loan Application]
    E --> F[Return Loan Application Status]
    D --> End[End Process]
    F --> End
```

### Assess Loan Application

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start: Assess Loan Application] --> B{Check Age between 18-100}
    B -- Age Invalid --> C[Return 'REJECTED']
    B -- Age Valid --> D{Check Credit Score}
    D -- Credit Score < 300 --> C
    D -- Credit Score Valid --> E[Calculate DTI]
    E --> F{Credit Score < 500}
    F -- Yes --> G{DTI < 0.35}
    F -- No --> H{Credit Score < 700}
    G -- Yes --> I[Return 'APPROVED']
    G -- No --> J{DTI <= 0.5}
    J -- Yes --> K[Return 'REVIEW']
    J -- No --> C
    H -- Yes --> L{DTI < 0.35}
    H -- No --> M{Credit Score >= 700}
    L -- Yes --> N{Employment Status = FULL_TIME}
    L -- No --> O{DTI <= 0.5}
    N -- Yes --> I
    N -- No --> K
    O -- Yes --> K
    O -- No --> C
    M -- Yes --> P{DTI < 0.35}
    M -- No --> C
    P -- Yes --> Q{Employment Status = FULL_TIME}
    P -- No --> K
    Q -- Yes --> I
    Q -- No --> K
