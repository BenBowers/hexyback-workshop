# Secondary Adapter

## Secondary Adapter

### Examine the `DynamoDBPutLoanApplication` secondary port

```typescript title="backend/src/ports/secondary/DynamoDBPutLoanApplication.ts"
import { EmploymentStatus } from '@/entities/EmploymentStatus';
import { LoanApplicationStatus } from '@/entities/LoanApplicationStatus';

export type PutLoanApplicationInput = {
  loanApplicationId: string;
  borrowerEmail: string;
  timestamp: string;
  creditScore: number;
  grossAnnualIncome: number;
  monthlyExpenses: number;
  loanApplicationStatus: LoanApplicationStatus;
  employmentStatus: EmploymentStatus;
};
export type PutLoanApplicationPort = (
  loanApplication: PutLoanApplicationInput
) => Promise<void>;
```

### Integration testing of the `DynamoDBPutLoanApplication` secondary port

```typescript title="backend/tests/integration/ddb-put-loan-application.spec.ts"
import { putLoanApplication } from '@/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application';
import { PutLoanApplicationInput } from '@/ports/secondary/DynamoDBPutLoanApplication';
import {
  DeleteItemCommand,
  DynamoDBClient,
  QueryCommand,
} from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
import { marshall, unmarshall } from '@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb';
import { randomUUID } from 'crypto';
import { Config } from 'sst/node/config';
import { afterEach, describe, expect, it } from 'vitest';

describe('ddb-put-loan-application', () => {
  const financialDataTableName = Config.FINANCIAL_DATA_TABLE_NAME;
  const client = new DynamoDBClient({});
  // ...
  const loanApplication: PutLoanApplicationInput = {
    borrowerEmail: `loan-application-ddb+${randomUUID()}@example.com`,
    loanApplicationId: randomUUID(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    creditScore: 700,
    grossAnnualIncome: 100000,
    monthlyExpenses: 5000,
    loanApplicationStatus: 'APPROVED',
    employmentStatus: 'FULL_TIME',
  };
  // Cleans up the DynamoDB Table after each test case
  afterEach(async () => {
    await deleteLoanApplication(
      loanApplication.borrowerEmail,
      loanApplication.loanApplicationId
    );
  });
  it(
    'writes a loan application record with ' +
      'PK of email and SK of LOAN_APPLICATION#loanApplicationId#TIMESTAMP#timestamp ' +
      'given a valid loan application',
    async () => {
      // **Hint** Take a look at the following integration test:
      // backend/tests/integration/ddb-put-borrowing-capacity-calculation.spec.ts
    }
  );

### Start the test watcher

Run the following command:

```shell
pnpm run test:integration
```

You should see a failing test case, similar to the following:

![Failing `Apply for Loan` integration test](/img/loan-application/failing-apply-for-loan-integration-test.png)

### Make the failing integration test pass

Navigate to `backend/src/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application.ts`.

You'll need to issue a DynamoDB `PutItemCommand` to persist the `LoanApplication` entity.

>Note: The `LoanApplication` entity has a `pk` consisting of the borrower's email. The `sk` is formatted as follows: `LOAN_APPLICATION#<loan-application-id>#TIMESTAMP#<timestamp>`

  Take a look at the <code>backend/src/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-borrowing-capacity-calculation.ts</code> secondary adapter.

  <summary>Solution</summary>

```typescript title="backend/src/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application.ts"
import { InternalError } from '@/errors/InternalError';
import { PutLoanApplicationPort } from '@/ports/secondary/DynamoDBPutLoanApplication';
import { DynamoDBClient, PutItemCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
import { marshall } from '@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb';
import { Config } from 'sst/node/config';

const dynamoDbClient = new DynamoDBClient();

export const putLoanApplication: PutLoanApplicationPort = async ({
  borrowerEmail,
  loanApplicationId,
  timestamp,
  creditScore,
  grossAnnualIncome,
  monthlyExpenses,
  loanApplicationStatus,
  employmentStatus,
}) => {
  await dynamoDbClient.send(
    new PutItemCommand({
      TableName: Config.FINANCIAL_DATA_TABLE_NAME,
      Item: marshall({
        pk: borrowerEmail,
        sk: `LOAN_APPLICATION#${loanApplicationId}#TIMESTAMP#${timestamp}`,
        loanApplicationId,
        timestamp,
        creditScore,
        grossAnnualIncome,
        monthlyExpenses,
        loanApplicationStatus,
        employmentStatus,
      }),
    })
  );
};
```

### But wait, there's more!

We're violating the port's interface if we let DynamoDB errors bubble up into the use case. The use case should only be concerned with domain entities and errors. Unfortunately, we can't force DynamoDB to fail on demand. 


>Question: Can you think of a way to simulate a DynamoDB failure? 

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  If you thought of <code>mocks</code>, then you're on the right track!
</details>

Navigate to the unit test for the secondary adapter: `backend/src/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application.spec.ts`.


We should avoid propagating DynamoDB errors into our use case. For this reason, we need to catch any such errors, and re-throw a domain specific error that can be handled deterministically in the use case. 


```typescript title="backend/src/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application.spec.ts"
describe('ddb-put-loan-application', () => {
  vi.mock('sst/node/config', () => ({
    Config: {
      FINANCIAL_DATA_TABLE_NAME: 'financial-data-table',
    },
  }));
  const dynamoDbMock = mockClient(DynamoDBClient);

  beforeEach(() => {
    dynamoDbMock.reset();
  });

  const loanApplication: PutLoanApplicationInput = {
    borrowerEmail: 'john.doe@example.com',
    creditScore: 700,
    employmentStatus: 'FULL_TIME',
    grossAnnualIncome: 100000,
    loanApplicationId: 'd5fe6ff5-20b3-4581-b38f-9b034c20d783',
    loanApplicationStatus: 'APPROVED',
    monthlyExpenses: 5000,
    timestamp: '2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z',
  };
  // highlight-start
  it('throws an InternalError when the dynamodb client rejects for any reason', async () => {
    dynamoDbMock.rejects(
      new DynamoDBServiceException({
        message: 'something went wrong',
        $metadata: {},
        name: 'ServiceException',
        $fault: 'client',
      })
    );
    await expect(putLoanApplication(loanApplication)).rejects.toBeInstanceOf(
      InternalError
    );
  });
  // highlight-end
});
```

### Start the test watcher

If your tests are not running, issue the following command:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

You should see a failing test case, similar to the following:

![Failing `Apply for Loan` integration test](/img/loan-application/failing-apply-for-loan-unit-test.png)

### Make the failing unit test pass

Navigate to `backend/src/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application.ts`.

You'll need wrap the call to `dynamoDBClient.send(...)` with a `try/catch` block.

  We want to stop DynamoDB errors from being propagated. Catch any error that is thrown and throw a <code>InternalError</code> instead.
