# Use Case


## Processing a loan application

Add the following test cases to `process-loan-application.spec.ts`:

```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
// ...
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  describe('given a borrower email, gross annual income, employment status and monthly expenses', () => {
    it.todo('fetches the borrowers profile from the database', async () => {
      await processLoanApplication(processLoanApplicationInput);
      expect(getBorrowerProfileSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        processLoanApplicationInput.borrowerEmail
      );
    });
    describe('given the borrower profile is not found', () => {
      it.todo('rejects with borrower not found error', () => {
        getBorrowerProfileSpy.mockResolvedValue(undefined);
        return expect(
          processLoanApplication(processLoanApplicationInput)
        ).rejects.toBeInstanceOf(BorrowerProfileDoesNotExistError);
      });
    });
    describe('given the get borrower profile adaptor rejects with an internal error', () => {
      it.todo('rejects with the error', () => {
      });
    });
    describe('given the borrower profile is successfully retrieved', () => {
      it.todo(
        'calls the assess loan application use case with the ' +
          'borrowers age, employment status, gross annual income, monthly expenses and credit score',
        async () => {
        }
      );
      it.todo('writes the loan application to the database', async () => {
      });
      describe('given the write to the database succeeds', () => {
        it.todo('resolves with the loan application status', () => {
        });
      });
      describe('given the write to the database rejects', () => {
        it.todo('rejects with the error', () => {
        });
      });
    });
  });
  // highlight-end
});
```

## Faking System Time

The calculation of the borrower's age is time dependent. To avoid the borrower`s calculated age changing, based on our system time, we need to mock the system time.


```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // highlight-start
  const systemTime = new Date(2024, 2, 15);
  const mockedTimestamp = systemTime.toISOString();
 
  beforeAll(() => {
    vi.useFakeTimers();
    vi.setSystemTime(systemTime);
  });
  afterAll(() => {
    vi.useRealTimers();
  });
  // highlight-end
  // ...
```

We're going to use `vi-test` fake timers to fix the system date time to 15th of March 2024. 

>Note: Months are 0-indexed, so March will be 2, not 3. Days funnily enough, are not 1-indexed. Go figure...

```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // highlight-next-line
  const systemTime = new Date(2024, 2, 15);
  const mockedTimestamp = systemTime.toISOString();
 
  beforeAll(() => {
    vi.useFakeTimers();
    vi.setSystemTime(systemTime);
  });
  afterAll(() => {
    vi.useRealTimers();
  });
  // ...
```

## Mocking the adapters

Because this is a unit test for the `process-loan-application` use case, we're only focussed on verifying the orchestration of the various tasks performed by the use case. 

So, we don't want to exercise the secondary DynamoDB adapters used to get a borrower profile and put a loan application. To do this we'll need to mock out both the `ddb-get-borrower-profile` and `ddb-put-loan-application` adapters:

```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  vi.mock('@/adaptors/secondary/ddb-get-borrower-profile', () => ({
    getBorrowerProfile: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(undefined)),
  }));
  const getBorrowerProfileSpy = vi.mocked(getBorrowerProfile);
  vi.mock('@/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application', () => ({
    putLoanApplication: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(undefined)),
  }));
  const putLoanApplicationSpy = vi.mocked(putLoanApplication);
  // highlight-end
  vi.mock('./assess-loan-application', () => ({
    assessLoanApplication: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(undefined)),
  }));
  const assessLoanApplicationSpy = vi.mocked(assessLoanApplication);
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.resetAllMocks();
    getBorrowerProfileSpy.mockResolvedValue(borrowerProfile);
    assessLoanApplicationSpy.mockReturnValue('APPROVED');
  });
  // ...
```

Additionally, we're not interested in testing the business logic, as it relates to assessing a loan application. We'll also need to mock out the calls to `assessLoanApplication`. 

```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  vi.mock('@/adaptors/secondary/ddb-get-borrower-profile', () => ({
    getBorrowerProfile: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(undefined)),
  }));
  const getBorrowerProfileSpy = vi.mocked(getBorrowerProfile);
  vi.mock('@/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application', () => ({
    putLoanApplication: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(undefined)),
  }));
  const putLoanApplicationSpy = vi.mocked(putLoanApplication);
  vi.mock('./assess-loan-application', () => ({
    assessLoanApplication: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(undefined)),
  }));
  //highlight-next-line
  const assessLoanApplicationSpy = vi.mocked(assessLoanApplication);
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.resetAllMocks();
    //highlight-next-line
    getBorrowerProfileSpy.mockResolvedValue(borrowerProfile);
    assessLoanApplicationSpy.mockReturnValue('APPROVED');
  });
  // ...
```

## Verify Retrieval of Borrower Profile

Unskip the test case. Remove the `.todo`: `it.todo(...)` --> `it(...)`:

```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
// ...
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  describe('given a borrower email, gross annual income, employment status and monthly expenses', () => {
    // highlight-next-line
    it('fetches the borrowers profile from the database', async () => {
      await processLoanApplication(processLoanApplicationInput);
      expect(getBorrowerProfileSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        processLoanApplicationInput.borrowerEmail
      );
    });
    // ...
  });
});
```
Note the currently failing test in your terminal:

![Failing secondary adapter test - fetch borrower from database](/img/loan-application/failing-secondary-adapter-test-fetch-borrower.png)

Next, make this test pass. To this, you'll need to get the borrower profile using the correct secondary adapter.

  import { ProcessLoanApplicationPort } from '@/ports/primary/ProcessLoanApplication';
  import { getYearsSinceCurrentDate } from '@/utils/get-years-since-current-date';
  import { randomUUID } from 'crypto';
  import { assessLoanApplication } from './assess-loan-application';
  
  const calculateAge = (dateOfBirth: Date): number => 
  getYearsSinceCurrentDate(dateOfBirth);
  export const processLoanApplication: ProcessLoanApplicationPort = async ({
    borrowerEmail,
    grossAnnualIncome,
    employmentStatus,
    monthlyExpenses,
  }) => { 
    //highlight-next-line
    const borrowerProfile = await getBorrowerProfile(borrowerEmail);
  }
```

</details>


## Handle Non-Existent Borrower Profile

Unskip the next test case. Remove the `.todo`: `it.todo(...)` --> `it(...)`:


```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
// ...
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  describe('given a borrower email, gross annual income, employment status and monthly expenses', () => {
    // ...
    describe('given the borrower profile is not found', () => {
      // highlight-next-line
      it('rejects with borrower not found error', () => {
        getBorrowerProfileSpy.mockResolvedValue(undefined);
        return expect(
          processLoanApplication(processLoanApplicationInput)
        ).rejects.toBeInstanceOf(BorrowerProfileDoesNotExistError);
      });
    });
    // ...
  });
});
```

### Start the test watcher

If your tests are not running, issue the following command:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

You should see a failing test case, similar to the following:

![2nd Failing `Apply for Loan` unit test](/img/loan-application/failing-apply-for-loan-unit-test-2.png)

### Make the failing unit test pass

Navigate to `backend/src/adaptors/secondary/ddb-put-loan-application.ts`.

Next, make this test pass.

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  To this, you'll need to throw a <code>BorrowerProfileDoesNotExistError</code> error if the <code>borrowerProfile</code>.

  const calculateAge = (dateOfBirth: Date): number => 
  getYearsSinceCurrentDate(dateOfBirth);
  export const processLoanApplication: ProcessLoanApplicationPort = async ({
    borrowerEmail,
    grossAnnualIncome,
    employmentStatus,
    monthlyExpenses,
  }) => { 
    const borrowerProfile = await getBorrowerProfile(borrowerEmail);
    //highlight-start
    if (!borrowerProfile) {
      throw new BorrowerProfileDoesNotExistError('Borrower profile not found');
    }
    //highlight-end
  }
```

</details>

## Handle Internal Error in Borrower Profile Adapter

Unskip the next test case. Remove the `.todo`: `it.todo(...)` --> `it(...)`:


```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
// ...
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  describe('given a borrower email, gross annual income, employment status and monthly expenses', () => {
    // ...
    describe('given the get borrower profile adaptor rejects with an internal error', () => {
      // highlight-next-line
      it('rejects with the error', () => {
        const error = new InternalError('Cheers Kent');
        getBorrowerProfileSpy.mockRejectedValue(error);
        return expect(
          processLoanApplication(processLoanApplicationInput)
        ).rejects.toBe(error);
      });
    });
    // ...
  });
});
```

### Start the test watcher

If your tests are not running, issue the following command:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

You should see a passing test case, similar to the following:

![3rd Passing `Apply for Loan` unit test](/img/loan-application/passing-apply-for-loan-unit-test-3.png)

>Note: The reason this test passes without any change required is because the secondary adapter (specification: `ddb-get-borrower-profile.spec.ts`) already throws an `InternalError` if a borrower profile cannot be found.

## Verify Loan Processing

Unskip the next test case. Remove the `.todo`: `it.todo(...)` --> `it(...)`:

```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
// ...
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  describe('given a borrower email, gross annual income, employment status and monthly expenses', () => {
    // ...
     describe('given the borrower profile is successfully retrieved', () => {
       // highlight-next-line
      it(
        'calls the assess loan application use case with the ' +
          'borrowers age, employment status, gross annual income, monthly expenses and credit score',
        async () => {}
      );
      // ...
     });
    // ...
  });
});
```

Next, write a failing test.

## Handle Internal Error in Loan Application Adapter

Unskip the next test case. Remove the `.todo`: `it.todo(...)` --> `it(...)`:

```typescript title="backend/src/use-cases/loan-assessment/process-loan-application.spec.ts"
// ...
describe('process loan-application', () => {
  // ...
  describe('given a borrower email, gross annual income, employment status and monthly expenses', () => {
    // ...
    describe('given the write to the database rejects', () => {
      // highlight-next-line
      it('rejects with the error', () => {
      });
    });
    // ...
  });
});
```

Next, write a failing test.

// ...
describe('process loan-application', () => {

  describe('given a borrower email, gross annual income, employment status and monthly expenses', () => {

    describe('given the write to the database rejects', () => {
      // highlight-next-line
      it('rejects with the error', () => {
          const error = new InternalError('Cheers Clint');
          putLoanApplicationSpy.mockRejectedValue(error);
          return expect(
            processLoanApplication(processLoanApplicationInput)
          ).rejects.toBe(error);
      });
    });
    // ...
  });
});
```

### Start the test watcher

If your tests are not running, issue the following command:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

You should see a passing test case, similar to the following:

![7th Passing `Apply for Loan` unit test](/img/loan-application/passing-apply-for-loan-unit-test-7.png)

>Note: The reason this test passes without any change required is because the secondary adapter (specification: `ddb-put-loan-application.spec.ts`) already throws an `InternalError` if a loan application cannot be persisted.
