# Borrowing Capacity

![Calculate Borrower's Borrowing Capacity](/img/borrowing-capacity/calculate-borrowers-borrowing-capacity.svg)

## Calculating Borrowing Capacity

1. User requests a borrowing capacity calculation through the client application.
2. The request hits the primary adaptor: `api-gw-calculate-borrowing-power`.
3. The primary adaptor passes the request to the `calculate-borrowing-capacity` use case in the domain layer.
4. The `calculate-borrowing-capacity` use case interacts with the `ddb-get-borrower-profile` secondary adapter to retrieve borrower profile from DynamoDB.
5. The `calculate-borrowing-capacity` use case calculates the borrowing capacity and uses a secondary adaptor `ddb-put-borrowing-capacity-calculation` to persist the borrowing capacity calculation to DynamoDB.
6. The estimated borrowing capacity is returned to the user through the primary adaptor.



## How Is Borrowing Capacity Calculated?

Borrowing capacity is calculated in three steps:

1. Calculate the borrower's _Base Borrowing Capacity (BBC)_
2. Adjust BBC according to Employment Status
3. Adjust the Employment Adjusted Borrowing Capacity based on borrower's age
4. Return the final _Borrowing Capacity_

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{INPUT: Age, Gross Annual Income, Employment Status}
    B --> C[Calculate Base Borrowing Capacity - BBC]
    C -->|Full-time| D[Employment Adjustment: 100% of BBC]
    C -->|Part-time| E[Employment Adjustment: 90% of BBC]
    C -->|Casual| F[Employment Adjustment: 80% of BBC]
    C -->|Self-employed| G[Employment Adjustment: 75% of BBC]
    D --> H{Age < 25 or Age > 60?}
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H
    H -->|Yes| I[Age Adjustment: Reduce by 10%]
    H -->|No| J[No Age Adjustment]
    I --> K[Return Final Borrowing Capacity]
    J --> K

```

There are various potential causes for this:

- DynamoDB Service Outage
- Lambda Service Outage
- Insufficient Permissions (Calculate Borrowing Capacity Use Case)
