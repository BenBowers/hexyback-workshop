# Explore Borrowing Capacity API

1. In your browser, navigate to the `Borrowing Capacity` API documentation:

    ```text
    http://localhost:3000/docs/hexy/get-an-estimate-of-your-borrowing-capacity
    ```

2. Modify the sample request parameters:

  ![Modify sample request parameters](/img/borrowing-capacity/modify-request-parameters.png)


3. Copy the `curl` request, replacing `http://localhost:3000` with the URL of your deployed API endpoint - `apiEndpoint`:

  ```shell
  âœ”  Deployed:
   ConfigStack
   # Use the URL shown below
   apiEndpoint: https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod/ 
  ```

4. Paste the `curl` request into your terminal and hit `Enter`:

  ```shell
  curl -L -X GET 'https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod/borrowingCapacity?borrowerEmail=rami@rolo.polo&grossAnnualIncome=50000&employmentStatus=SELF_EMPLOYED' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
  ```

5. Navigate to the AWS Lambda console and select the `CalculateBorrowingCapacity` lambda

  ![Select `CalculateBorrowingCapacity` lambda on AWS Lambda console](/img/borrowing-capacity/select-calculate-borrowing-capacity-lambda-aws-console.png)

6. Navigate to the `Monitor` tab:

  ![Navigate to the `Monitor` tab for the `CalculateBorrowingCapacity` lambda](/img/borrowing-capacity/navigate-to-monitor-tab-for-calculate-borrowing-capacity-lambda.png)

7. Click on the first entry in the `Traces` tab:

  ![Navigate to the `Traces` tab for the `CalculateBorrowingCapacity` lambda](/img/borrowing-capacity/navigate-to-traces-tab-for-calculate-borrowing-power-lambda.png)

  Observe the traces shown. You'll notice two calls:
    - A call to (attempt) to get the borrower profile
    - A call to put the borrowing capacity calculation 

## Exercise:

1. Attempt to calculate the borrowing capacity for a borrower that does not exist. What happens? Observe the traces to confirm your assumptions.
